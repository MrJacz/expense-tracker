## ðŸ”§ Implementation Guide

### To integrate these improvements:

1. **Install required dependencies:**
```bash
npm install vaul cmdk @radix-ui/react-scroll-area @radix-ui/react-avatar @radix-ui/react-dialog class-variance-authority
```

2. **Update your dashboard page:**
```typescript

```

3. **Add onboarding check:**
```typescript
const [showOnboarding, setShowOnboarding] = useState(false);
const [showMobileForm, setShowMobileForm] = useState(false);

// Check if user needs onboarding
useEffect(() => {
  const hasCompletedOnboarding = localStorage.getItem('onboarding_completed');
  if (!hasCompletedOnboarding) {
    setShowOnboarding(true);
  }
}, []);
```

4. **Implement responsive form logic:**
```typescript
const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');

const handleAddExpense = () => {
  if (isMobile) {
    setShowMobileForm(true);
  } else {
    setShowDesktopForm(true);
